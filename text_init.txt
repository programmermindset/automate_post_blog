paCreating a site or a page with animation doesn’t have to mean building the whole thing in some big, complicated animation app or framework. Even something as simple as animating a link hover effect with CSS adds a bit of visual spark.
paCSS transitions and transformations can be combined to create fantastic effects, including Star Wars-style screen wipes. But you may need to consider using JavaScript for greater flexibility and control.
paTo a designer, particularly one who doesn’t do a lot of coding, that idea can seem a little off-putting. Helpfully, however, there are a number of JavaScript libraries specifically designed to create animated effects. You will need to get into the code a bit, but the point of these libraries is that someone has already done most of the heavy lifting for you. If you can follow simple instructions, you can use JavaScript libraries to enhance your designs.
paBefore you start looking for a library, it helps to be clear on what you are looking for. Think about what animation effects you want, then break them into their constituent parts. All simple animation breaks down to fading, sliding, scaling, or rotating, controlled by timers that handle delays, easing, and playing order, and triggers (events) — such as scrolling, tapping, or page loading — that start and stop the animation running. The more of these functions you combine, the more complex the animation becomes.
paNow we’ve got that out of the way, let’s look at some libraries, starting with the simplest and moving on to the more challenging (but still manageable) offerings.
h2AniJS
paIf you are new to animation or to JavaScript, AniJS is a great place to start. It is a UI interaction library that allows you to use JavaScript to control CSS animations without writing any JavaScript. It turns JavaScript into ‘plain’ language — if: event, do: action, to: element. Since this also mimics JavaScript’s basic syntax, it can help a non-coder get comfortable with JS. Plus, you can get more advanced with it if you want to.
paThere are lots of demos and examples, and it has a resource page — the AniCollection — which has a ton of ready-made animations you can download and use.
